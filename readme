This is a text-based role-playing game in Python. I feel ambitious about it and will learn whatever is needed to do my creations.
I make digital art and music, so I will add those to the game somehow.
My friend Mati plays bass in my band; he helps with this.
My friend Stefan helped too, with the methods and classes.
Have fun!
