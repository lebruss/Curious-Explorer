This is a text-based role-playing game in Python. I am having fun making it, and am learning as I go. Whatever it takes to share my creation.
I want to help the user feel control of a fantasy world and do as they wish with their imagination.

I make digital art and music, so I will add those to the game somehow.
My friend Mati plays bass in my band; he helps with this.
My friend Stefan helped too, with the methods and classes.
Have fun!
